# Here's a mindbender for you:

a = 10
b = 20
a = b
print(f"a is {a}")
print(f"b is {b}")

# @TASK: What does that output? And why? Take a guess, then
# run the code and see.

#20, as a must equal whatever is in b and ignore the value assigned as the a = b comes last in order

# Was it what you expected? Yes

# Try to puzzle it out, and then move on to
# 020_state_tables.py
